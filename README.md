## About $Retro-site

$Retro-site is currently a work-in-progress project meant for the FIICode 2020 Contest. It's meant to present how an online marketplace would look like in the 90'-00's. $Retro-site is just a middle-man of the buy/sell action. $Retro-site does not take responsibility for eventual theft, hustling or other means of law breaking. $Retro-site can be selective with the sell announcements that are added and reserves it's right to choose it's users. A further code of conduct will be available on the final version.

The final version should include:

- Platform to sell/buy items
- Platform to find the nearest post-office from where you can contact the buyer/seller
- Check-out page will be just a mean of contact, no actual money included (imitating the technological limitations of the retro time)
- ...
