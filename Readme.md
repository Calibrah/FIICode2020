## About Piazeta

[Piazeta](https://piazeta.com/) is a project meant for the FIICode 2020 Contest. Piazeta is a marketplace dedicated to the exchange of Retro-themed goods, usually collectibles. Piazeta is just a middle-man of the buy/sell action. 

Our features include:

- Creating an account and everything associated with it ( Manage your profile, change your password, view your transaction history)
- For products: Add your own product to the market and make it visible to others; View all products on the market (Filter them or search directly); Manage your cart and place orders;
- Orders: After an order is placed, the seller will receive a mail about your intent to buy his product. He will then have to choose whether or not to accept it. In case of a confirmation, both of you will receive each others contact details and from then on you can talk into finishing the deal. It's the sellers responsibility to validate (Confirm the final status) of the order.
- Other features include: Information about letters and mailing (#keepitretro); Finding the nearest postal office around you(more cities to be added); About page and [Social Media](https://instagram.com/piazetaa); A full GDPR Compliant Application that doesn't store unencrypted User data.
